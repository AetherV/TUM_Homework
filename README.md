###BlueJ
BlueJ automatically comes with JUnit, thus you will not need to import it into your project. Simply copy the Java Unit Test File into your projects folder and restart BlueJ (fix any packages if required). The Unit Test should be availible, like your other classes. Simply right click it and hit Test All.
