### Purpose of a Unit Test 

The Unit Test's purpose, is to help identify errors in the programs written for PGDP and GAD. It does this by creating test cases, in which inputs are entered into the classes, methods being run and finally checking to see if the output is what is to be expected.

##### BlueJ
